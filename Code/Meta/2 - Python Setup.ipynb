    "It's relatively straightforward to get Python and the tools you'll need installed if you're running a Linux distribution like Ubuntu. In fact, for some of you it may be easier to run an Ubuntu virtual machine (a computer being simulated by a computer) than try to get everything working on your normal machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of this method is the performance penalty that comes from running your code inside a computer inside another computer. The main advantage of this method is that it lets people with different computers run Python as if they had the same computer. This is an advantage because it means I can test it once and it should work for everyone.\n",

    "The details of how to to do this are in the section named **Vagrant Setup**. That section will have you install two pieces of software, after which a single command will install Python."
