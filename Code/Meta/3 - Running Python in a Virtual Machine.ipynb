    "[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a tool for managing virtual machines (VMs). A VM is a computer that is being simulated inside of another computer. When used in conjuction with [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) (a piece of software that handles the simulation of the computer) it can be used to set up Python in a relatively painless manner."
